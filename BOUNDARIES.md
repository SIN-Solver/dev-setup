# dev-setup Boundaries

## Role

`dev-setup` documents and standardizes development environment setup for OpenSIN systems.

Short version:

- **This repo = setup and environment standards**
- **Not this repo = first-run product onboarding, product shell, or control-plane truth**

## Canonical Ownership

| Concern                         | Canonical Repo            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Environment and setup standards | `dev-setup`               |
| First-run onboarding automation | `OpenSIN-onboarding`      |
| Product web app                 | `OpenSIN-WebApp`          |
| Internal ops control plane      | `ai-agent-system`         |
| Official documentation          | `OpenSIN-documentation`   |
| OpenCode config canon           | `upgraded-opencode-stack` |

## Hard rules

### 1. Setup standards, not onboarding monopoly

This repo may define stable environment setup guidance. It must not absorb all first-run automation flows that belong in onboarding.

### 2. Setup standards, not product or ops surface

This repo must not become the product app, account portal, or operator control plane.

### 3. Setup alignment, not config canon ownership

This repo should reference canonical config where needed rather than silently becoming the config source of truth.
